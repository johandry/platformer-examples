# Terranova Examples

This repository contain examples about how to use the [Terranova](https://github.com/johandry/terranova) package. The examples are organized in the following categories:

- **AWS**: All the examples in this directory use Terranova and AWS.
  - [EC2](./aws/ec2/): This example is to create, scale or terminate AWS EC2 instances using the Terranova package 
  - [Simple](./aws/simple/): This example is just to create just one AWS EC2 instance. As simple as that. I also use it to test my local version of Terranova.
- **[Terraform](./terraform)**: This example do not use Terranova, it use the Terraform package just like Terranova uses it.
